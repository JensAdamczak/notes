<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The story of establishing a culture of freedom and resonsponsibility at Netflix.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Netflix leadership has identified two key ingredients for a creative and innovative culture: candor and talent density. Employees are empowered to contribute their opinions and ideas. They need to get enough context about the business priorities to take ownership and make informed decisions without the burden of a buerocratic approval process. Netflix aims to attract top talent and rather pays for one highly capable employee than for ten mediocre ones.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you can’t afford to pay your best employees top of market, then let go of some of the less fabulous people in order to do so. That way, the talent will become even denser.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;When you succeed, speak about it softly or let others mention it for you. But when you make a mistake say it clearly and loudly, so that everyone can learn and profit from your errors. In other words, &lsquo;Whisper wins and shout mistakes.'&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;These are all ways of controlling people rather than inspiring them. It’s not easy to avoid chaos and anarchy as you remove these controls, but if you develop every employee’s sense of self-discipline and responsibility, help them develop enough knowledge to make good decisions, and develop a feedback culture to stimulate learning, you’ll be amazed at how effective your organization can be.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What we’ve learned is that in order to integrate your corporate culture around the world, above all you have to be humble, you have to be curious, and you have to remember to listen before you speak and to learn before you teach. With this approach, you can’t help but become more effective every day in this ever-fascinating multicultural world.&quot;</em></p>
