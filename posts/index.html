  <section>
    <p>Author Ray Dalio
Summary A historical account of the rise and fall of empires and the reasons behind them.
Takeaways History is repeating itself in well-defined cycles that determine the world order and the relationship of countries. Empires and dynasties rise and decline in a Big Cycle that is driven by universal cause and effect relationships that are in turn determined by fundamental characteristics of human nature such as fear, greed, jealousy, and other basic emotions....</p>

  <section>
    <p>Author Tim Palmer
Summary An introduction to the geometry of chaos and the important role it plays in understanding scientific phenomena.
Takeaways The climate and the economy are examples of highly complex non-linear systems. The evolution of these systems follows a fractal geometric pattern along an attractor, i.e. a set of allowed states in a high dimensional state space. Despite the fact that an exact future state is often uncomputable, mathematical models have been successfully developed to characterize possible future behavior in the form of ensembles along the attractor....</p>

  <section>
    <p>Author Sabine Hossenfelder
Summary Scientific answers to existential questions.
Takeaways Existential questions deal with the origin and working mechanisms of the universe, and the role of humans in it. While the fundamental theories of the standard model of particle physics and the theory of general relativity have been very successful in providing explanations, many questions have no scientifically sound answer yet. In their attempt to extend our knowledge, some scientists include assumptions in their theories that are unnecessary to explain observations, conflating scientific reasoning and belief....</p>

  <section>
    <p>Author Joseph Buchdahl
Summary An analysis of the science, psychology and philosophy of gambling.
Takeaway Gambling is the speculation on the future that can take on different forms such as casino games, sports betting, and financial investing. Outcomes in these areas are hard to predict and it is even harder to make money from it against benchmarks that encapsulate the collective information of large crowds. Gamblers often underestimate the randomness that determine gambling outcomes and attribute positive outcomes to their own ability to predict the future....</p>

Summary Anecdotes about modern leaders and their approach to decision making.
Takeaways We experience a time of accelerated change that is unlikely to slow down in the future. With new technologies emerging and more data being available to influence decision making, leaders need to adjust their way of approaching problems. For example, successful leaders in the “algorithmic age” apply first principles thinking to come up with solutions that can be carried out by computers....</p>
