<p>Practical tips to develop a richer lifesyle.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Working hard for decades to afford an enjoyable retirement is an outdated concept. It is better to schedule mini-retirements and other exciting activities periodically. A &ldquo;newly rich&rdquo; lifestyle can be financed by developing products or ideas that can be sold to generate cash flow outside of established employment patterns.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&quot;&lsquo;Someday&rsquo; is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it &lsquo;eventually,&rsquo; just do it and correct course along the way.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The question you should be asking isn’t, &lsquo;What do I want?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What are my goals?&rsquo; but &lsquo;What would excite me?'&quot;</em></p>
