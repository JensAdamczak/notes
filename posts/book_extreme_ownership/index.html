<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A set of leadership principles from the Navy Seals and how to apply them to the business context.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Successful leaders need to take ownership to the next level. &ldquo;Extreme Ownership&rdquo; includes owning up to mistakes, believing in the mission, and providing enough context for subordinates and supervisors. The best leaders keep their egos in check and critically assess how they can contribute to the team&rsquo;s success.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. The leader must own everything in his or her world. There is no one else to blame. The leader must acknowledge mistakes and admit failures, take ownership of them, and develop a plan to win.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a true believer in the mission. Even when others doubt and question the amount of risk, asking, “Is it worth it?” the leader must believe in the greater cause. If a leader does not believe, he or she will not take the risks required to overcome the inevitable challenges necessary to win. And they will not be able to convince others—especially the frontline troops who must execute the mission—to do so. Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are part of something greater than themselves and their own personal interests.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Ego clouds and disrupts everything: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticism. It can even stifle someone’s sense of self-preservation. Often, the most difficult ego to deal with is your own.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success. When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them. And when things go wrong, and they inevitably do go wrong, complexity compounds issues that can spiral out of control into total disaster. Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise.&quot;</em></p>
