<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The personal story of former Navy SEAL David Goggins who overcame traumatic experiences to become a successful soldier and athlete.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Most people do not know what they are truly capable of and resist challenging themselves physically and mentally to stretch the limits of their potential.</p>
<p>Unlocking this potential requires hard work and dedicated exposure to uncomfortable experiences and pain to &ldquo;callous&rdquo; the mind and become mentally strong.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the time I graduated, I knew that the confidence I’d managed to develop didn’t come from a perfect family or God-given talent. It came from personal accountability which brought me self-respect, and self-respect will always light a way forward.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A true leader stays exhausted, abhors arrogance, and never looks down on the weakest link. He fights for his men and leads by example.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Starting at zero is a mindset that says my refrigerator is never full, and it never will be. We can always become stronger and more agile, mentally and physically. We can always become more capable and more reliable. Since that’s the case we should never feel that our work is done. There is always more to do.&quot;</em></p>
