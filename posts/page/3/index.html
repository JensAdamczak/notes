    <p>Author Philip Reeve
Summary The fictional tale of traveling cities and their residents that battle for survival in a distant future.

  <h1 class="title">Book: Factfulness</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Author Hans Rosling
Summary A plea to overcome the human instincts that prevent us from developing a fact based worldview.
Takeaways Knowledge of global patterns and trends is poor across demographics even though data is publicly available. Common assumptions about topics like population growth, income inequality, education and health, are not only wrong but are systematically distorted.

    <p>Author Adam Rutherford
Summary A scientific view of the role that DNA plays in understanding human history, and what we can and cannot conclude when analyzing it.
