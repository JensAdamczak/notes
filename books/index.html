<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Ray Dalio</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A historical account of the rise and fall of empires and the reasons behind them.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>History is repeating itself in well-defined cycles that determine the world order and the relationship of countries. Empires and dynasties rise and decline in a Big Cycle that is driven by universal cause and effect relationships that are in turn determined by fundamental characteristics of human nature such as fear, greed, jealousy, and other basic emotions. Each cycle has clear markers that allows us to see where we are in it.</p>
<p>Within each cycle are other cycles. The most important three cycles are the long-term debt and capital markets cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, and the external order and disorder cycle. Each cycle follows a specific progression. As an example, the internal order cycles typically proceeds in the following way.</p>
<ol>
<li>New internal order and new leadership</li>
<li>Resource-allocation systems and government bureaucracies are built and refined</li>
<li>Peace and prosperity</li>
<li>Excess and widening of wealth and other gaps</li>
<li>Bad financial conditions and intense conflicts</li>
<li>Civil wars and revolution</li>
</ol>
<p>As we move through the cycles we will encounter times that are radically different than the past but similar to many times in history. Developing a deeper understanding of the universal principles that govern the development of cycles and new world orders helps to better anticipate what is to come.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Values change from generation to generation during the rise to the top—from those who had to fight to achieve wealth and power to those who inherited it. The new generation is less battle-hardened, steeped in luxuries, and accustomed to the easy life, which makes them more vulnerable to challenges.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the way, spending money on investment and infrastructure rather than on consumption tends to lead to greater productivity, so investment is a good leading indicator of prosperity.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In fact, improvements in education and infrastructure, even those financed by debt, were essential ingredients behind the rises of virtually all empires, and declines in the quality of these investments were almost always ingredients behind empires’ declines. If done well, these interventions can more than counterbalance the classic toxic mix.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Watch populism and polarization as markers. The more that populism and polarization exist, the further along a nation is in Stage 5, and the closer it is to civil war and revolution. In Stage 5, moderates become the minority. In Stage 6, they cease to exist.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>An introduction to the geometry of chaos and the important role it plays in understanding scientific phenomena.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The climate and the economy are examples of highly complex non-linear systems. The evolution of these systems follows a fractal geometric pattern along an attractor, i.e. a set of allowed states in a high dimensional state space. Despite the fact that an exact future state is often uncomputable, mathematical models have been successfully developed to characterize possible future behavior in the form of ensembles along the attractor. These models allow to make probabilitic forecasts and statements about the likelihood that a future state will be vastly different from the present.</p>
<p>Invariant set theory applies the concept of the &ldquo;geometry of chaos&rdquo; to quantum mechanics and concludes that the laws of physics are deterministic and that its laws describe the geometry of the attractor/invariant set of the highest-order system imaginable-the universe as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;The whole universe is a nonlinear dynamical system evolving on some fractal attractor in cosmological state space.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Using the geometry of chaos, Einstein’s picture of an ensemble of deterministic worlds may be right after all. If this is so, we conclude that we do live in a world in which elementary particles, and indeed the notion of reality, are certain and definite.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In short, I am suggesting that to be conscious of an object is to be aware that the object has an existence independent of the rest of the world. I am speculating that this awareness is itself a consequence of two claims: that for reasons of energy efficiency quantum physics does play a role in cognition, and that the laws of quantum physics at their most fundamental describe the geometry of the cosmological invariant set.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Scientific answers to existential questions.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Existential questions deal with the origin and working mechanisms of the universe, and the role of humans in it. While the fundamental theories of the standard model of particle physics and the theory of general relativity have been very successful in providing explanations, many questions have no scientifically sound answer yet. In their attempt to extend our knowledge, some scientists include assumptions in their theories that are unnecessary to explain observations, conflating scientific reasoning and belief.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;While the situation is not entirely settled, it seems that the laws of nature preserve information entirely, so all the details that make up you and the story of your grandmother’s life are immortal.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But in which sense are they real? Unobservable universes are by definition unnecessary to describe what we observe. Hence, assuming they are real is also unnecessary. Scientific theories should not contain unnecessary assumptions, for if we allow that, we would also have to allow the assumption that a god made the universe.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That way, we can rephrase any discussion about free will or moral responsibility without using those terms. For example, instead of questioning someone’s free will, we can debate whether jail is really the most useful intervention.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>An analysis of the science, psychology and philosophy of gambling.</p>
<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>
<p>Gambling is the speculation on the future that can take on different forms such as casino games, sports betting, and financial investing. Outcomes in these areas are hard to predict and it is even harder to make money from it against benchmarks that encapsulate the collective information of large crowds. Gamblers often underestimate the randomness that determine gambling outcomes and attribute positive outcomes to their own ability to predict the future.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that gambling is only lucrative for a negligible number of skilled gamblers, people continue to gamble. This might be related to the human desire to explain and control outcomes to instill a sense of certainy in an uncertain world.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;According to this hypothesis, if reward uncertainty was not a source of motivation most predictive behaviours would extinguish because of the high failure rate. In other words, allowing an animal to persevere in a task is only possible if its behavior is motivated by a lack of predictability rather than the reward itself.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If the purpose of gambling is to achieve authority over uncertainty, to feel in control of one&rsquo;s destiny, surely everyone who plays sensibly and reasonably is a winner.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where luck is dominant, there is very little connection between the process and the outcome. If all you care about is outcomes, you&rsquo;re liable to draw erroneous conclusions. On the contrary, don&rsquo;t study winners to see what caused them; study the process to see whether it consistently led to success.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Anecdotes about modern leaders and their approach to decision making.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>We experience a time of accelerated change that is unlikely to slow down in the future. With new technologies emerging and more data being available to influence decision making, leaders need to adjust their way of approaching problems. For example, successful leaders in the &ldquo;algorithmic age&rdquo; apply first principles thinking to come up with solutions that can be carried out by computers.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you are simply automating your existing processes, adding a chatbot to your website, or updating your mobile app, then in all probability you are not thinking big enough about your future opportunities. Too often, digital transformation is just digital incrementalism.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the future, the most effective computational thinkers will be those who can directly express their ideas and execute their strategies in domain-specific programming languages.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Dumbing down AI platforms to the extent that we can actually understand them may undermine their effectiveness. It is often more important to know why a particular optimum or target was chosen than to be able to explain the reasoning behind an algorithmic decision.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A collection of stories that illustrate how to think more productively, creatively, and rationally.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>People have difficulties thinking rationally. They have biases that leads them to seek evidence that confirms what they already think, or are tempted to adopt views of friends, families, and colleagues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking like a freak&rdquo; means to get comfortable with admiting to not know the answer to a question. A &ldquo;freak&rdquo; re-defines the problem to answer the right questions, identifies the root cause, and thinks small to avoid intractable problems.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, deciphering them—is the key to understanding a problem, and how it might be solved. Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A growing body of research suggests that even the smartest people tend to seek out evidence that confirms what they already think, rather than new information that would give them a more robust view of reality.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thinking like a Freak may sometimes sound like an exercise in using clever means to get exactly what you want, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if there is one thing we’ve learned from a lifetime of designing and analyzing incentives, the best way to get what you want is to treat other people with decency.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Vincent A. W. J. Marchau, Warren E. Walker, Pieter J. T. M. Bloemen, Steven W. Popper</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A review of methods and applications for decision making under deep uncertainty.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Situations with deep uncertainty are characterized by a lack of knowledge about how future events will unfold. In complex systems, the predictability of potential outcomes is low.</p>
<p>When confronted with deep uncertainty, decision makers are advised to shift from a predict-then-act paradigm to a monitor-and-adapt strategy. Traditional planning approaches make assumptions, predict outcomes, and tailor a policy to the predictions. Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMUDU) approaches, on the other hand, propose a policy, identify vulnerabilities, and assess the best options for reducing the identified vulnerabilities.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;The intrinsic limits to predictability, the existence of legitimate alternative interpretations of the same data, and the limits to knowability of a system have important implications for decisionmaking. Under the label of ‘decisionmaking under deep uncertainty’, these are now being explored.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is ample evidence that human reasoning with respect to complex uncertain systems is intrinsically insufficient. Often, mental models are event based, have an open-loop view of causality, ignore feedback, fail to account for time delays, and are insensitive to nonlinearity (Sterman 1994).&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That is, under deep uncertainty decision support should move away from trying to define what is the right choice and instead aim at enabling deliberation and joint sense making among the various parties to a decision.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In short, there are five categories of components: policy architecture, generation of scenarios, generation of alternatives, definition of robustness, and vulnerability analysis. Any given DMDU approach makes choices with respect to these five categories. For some, these choices are primarily or almost exclusively in one category while remaining silent on the others. For others, implicit or explicit choices are made with respect to each category.&quot;</em></p>

<p>The story of a plant manager who discovers the benefit of systematically assessing the processing bottlenecks instead of relying on conventional wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Instead of relying on conventional wisdom, it is crucial to deeply reflect on the goal of an operation or organization and take a scientific and systematic approach to explore the factors (bottlenecks or constraints) that prevent us from reaching it.</p>
<p>The following process can serve as a blueprint to work towards achieving any goal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the system&rsquo;s constraint.</li>
<li>Decide how to exploit the system&rsquo;s constraint.</li>
<li>Subordinate everything else to the above decisions.</li>
<li>Elevate the system&rsquo;s constraint.</li>
<li>If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken, go back to step 1, but do not allow inertia to cause a system constraint.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Finally, and most importantly, I wanted to show that we can all be outstanding scientists. The secret of being a good scientist, I believe, lies not in our brain power. We have enough. We simply need to look at reality and think logically and precisely about what we see. The key ingredient is to have the courage to face inconsistencies between what we see and deduce and the way things are done.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I stop and look at him. “What are we asking for? For the ability to answer three simple questions: &lsquo;what to change?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what to change to?&rsquo;, and &lsquo;how to cause the change?&rsquo; Basically what we are asking for is the most fundamental abilities one would expect from a manager. Think about it. If a manager doesn&rsquo;t know how to answer those three questions, is he or she entitled to be called manager?”</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The lesson that Shewhart brought to manufacturing from Physics, and Deming made known worldwide, is that trying to be more accurate than the noise (in our case, trying to use sophisticated algorithms that consider every possible parameter in an environment of high variability) does not improve things but makes them worse—the results will most certainly not be an improvement but a deterioration in due-date performance.&quot;</em></p>
