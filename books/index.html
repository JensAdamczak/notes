<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The history of Teck Resources, Canada&rsquo;s largest diversified mining company, from 1912 to 2023.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Commodity prices can fluctuate widely through economic cycles. It is important for a mining company to retain a strong balance sheet to survive tough times and be ready to act on opportunities when they arise.</p>
<p>The mining business is characterized by frequent mergers and acquisition and often complex financing arrangements involving multiple mining and investment companies. Teck&rsquo;s philosophy has been to position itself to be a partner of choice for other mining companies and developers, i.e. a preferred developer through demonstrated expertise in building new mines and respectful business conduct.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten that. The willingness to pass ideas and information freely back and forth can often lead, synergistically, to two or more people coming up with even better ones. Hording ideas and information is the dystopian practice of the bureaucrat.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We have said many times: &lsquo;A mining company without ore reserves is an oxymoron,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The three key elements of a successful resources company are its ore reserves, the right people to develop and operate them, and the financial strength to pull it off.&rsquo; It can never be said too often.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Doing a few things very well with your nose to the grindstone always beats spinning wheels on too many things. Challenges and delays are just that, meaning one needs to put in even more effort to get past them. One should never accept easily that it is so much harder this time. It was seldom as easy as, looking back, it may now seem.&quot;</em></p>

  </h1>

<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Ray Dalio</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A historical account of the rise and fall of empires and the reasons behind them.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>History is repeating itself in well-defined cycles that determine the world order and the relationship of countries. Empires and dynasties rise and decline in a Big Cycle that is driven by universal cause and effect relationships that are in turn determined by fundamental characteristics of human nature such as fear, greed, jealousy, and other basic emotions. Each cycle has clear markers that allows us to see where we are in it.</p>
<p>Within each cycle are other cycles. The most important three cycles are the long-term debt and capital markets cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle, and the external order and disorder cycle. Each cycle follows a specific progression. As an example, the internal order cycles typically proceeds in the following way.</p>
<ol>
<li>New internal order and new leadership</li>
<li>Resource-allocation systems and government bureaucracies are built and refined</li>
<li>Peace and prosperity</li>
<li>Excess and widening of wealth and other gaps</li>
<li>Bad financial conditions and intense conflicts</li>
<li>Civil wars and revolution</li>
</ol>
<p>As we move through the cycles we will encounter times that are radically different than the past but similar to many times in history. Developing a deeper understanding of the universal principles that govern the development of cycles and new world orders helps to better anticipate what is to come.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Values change from generation to generation during the rise to the top—from those who had to fight to achieve wealth and power to those who inherited it. The new generation is less battle-hardened, steeped in luxuries, and accustomed to the easy life, which makes them more vulnerable to challenges.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the way, spending money on investment and infrastructure rather than on consumption tends to lead to greater productivity, so investment is a good leading indicator of prosperity.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In fact, improvements in education and infrastructure, even those financed by debt, were essential ingredients behind the rises of virtually all empires, and declines in the quality of these investments were almost always ingredients behind empires’ declines. If done well, these interventions can more than counterbalance the classic toxic mix.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Watch populism and polarization as markers. The more that populism and polarization exist, the further along a nation is in Stage 5, and the closer it is to civil war and revolution. In Stage 5, moderates become the minority. In Stage 6, they cease to exist.&quot;</em></p>

  <section>
    <p><img src="img/book_cover_the_party.jpg" alt="The Party"></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A historical analysis of the working mechanisms of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been the sole legitimate governing authority in China since 1949. By the end of 2009 when the book was published, the CCP had 78 million members.</p>
<p>The Party consists of a giant network of people that are involved in every important decision and its members have built up the skills and experience to run the country. It has remained in power by supporting a boisterous private economy and keeping strict control over personnel, propaganda, and the army. Since the Party was founded it has systematically &ldquo;has eradicated or emasculated political rivals; eliminated the autonomy of the courts and press; restricted religion and civil society; deningrated rival versions of nationhood; centralized political power; established extensive networks of security police; and dispatched dissidents to labour camps.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;As an organization, the Party sits outside, and above the law. It should have a legal identity, in other words, a person to sue, but it is not even registered as an organization. The Party exists outside the legal system altogether.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Party’s control over personnel was at the heart of its ability to overhaul state companies, without losing leverage over them at the same time. So important does the Party rate its power to hire and fire government officials that it places it on a par with its control over the media and the military.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The policy cycles follow a familiar pattern, the Chinese economists say: ‘Decentralization leads to disorder; disorder leads to centralization; centralization leads to stagnation and stagnation leads to decentralization.’&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Deng, and Jiang after him, grasped what many of their conservative opponents never did–that the Party had much in common with private entrepreneurs, who disliked democratic politics and independent unions as much as they did. The Party’s authoritarian powers not only kept workers in line. They also bestowed on policy-makers a flexibility that politicians in democratic countries could only dream about. Even by the standards of a capitalist economy, the Party could be unusually pro-business, as long as the state got a cut along the way.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Joseph Buchdahl</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>An analysis of the science, psychology and philosophy of gambling.</p>
<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>
<p>Gambling is the speculation on the future that can take on different forms such as casino games, sports betting, and financial investing. Outcomes in these areas are hard to predict and it is even harder to make money from it against benchmarks that encapsulate the collective information of large crowds. Gamblers often underestimate the randomness that determine gambling outcomes and attribute positive outcomes to their own ability to predict the future.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that gambling is only lucrative for a negligible number of skilled gamblers, people continue to gamble. This might be related to the human desire to explain and control outcomes to instill a sense of certainy in an uncertain world.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;According to this hypothesis, if reward uncertainty was not a source of motivation most predictive behaviours would extinguish because of the high failure rate. In other words, allowing an animal to persevere in a task is only possible if its behavior is motivated by a lack of predictability rather than the reward itself.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If the purpose of gambling is to achieve authority over uncertainty, to feel in control of one&rsquo;s destiny, surely everyone who plays sensibly and reasonably is a winner.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Where luck is dominant, there is very little connection between the process and the outcome. If all you care about is outcomes, you&rsquo;re liable to draw erroneous conclusions. On the contrary, don&rsquo;t study winners to see what caused them; study the process to see whether it consistently led to success.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The history of the rise and fall of the East India Company.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The East India company was a trading company based in London that rose from humble beginnings to a fully fledged imperial power that managed to replace the ruling Mughal empire on the Indian subcontinent in a short period of time between 1756 and 1803. In that time period the East India Company extended their sphere of influence through treachery, forged contracts, collaboration with local banker, bribes, and military prowess in armed conflicts and wars.</p>
<p>As a company, the EIC was answerable only to its shareholders. With no stake in the just governance of the region, or its long-term well-being, the Company&rsquo;s rule quickly turned into the straightforward pillage of India, and the rapid transfer westwards of its wealth.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;In many ways the East India Company was a model of commercial efficiency: one hundred years into its history, it had only thirty-five permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world history.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the end it was this access to unlimited reserves of credit, partly through stable flows of land revenues, and partly through the collaboration of Indian moneylenders and financiers, that in this period finally gave the Company its edge over their Indian rivals.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Because it was not the British government that seized India in the middle of the eighteenth century, but a private company. India&rsquo;s transition to colonialism took place through the mechanism of a for-profit corporation, which existed entirely for the purpose of enriching its investors.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Anecdotes about modern leaders and their approach to decision making.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>We experience a time of accelerated change that is unlikely to slow down in the future. With new technologies emerging and more data being available to influence decision making, leaders need to adjust their way of approaching problems. For example, successful leaders in the &ldquo;algorithmic age&rdquo; apply first principles thinking to come up with solutions that can be carried out by computers.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you are simply automating your existing processes, adding a chatbot to your website, or updating your mobile app, then in all probability you are not thinking big enough about your future opportunities. Too often, digital transformation is just digital incrementalism.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the future, the most effective computational thinkers will be those who can directly express their ideas and execute their strategies in domain-specific programming languages.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Dumbing down AI platforms to the extent that we can actually understand them may undermine their effectiveness. It is often more important to know why a particular optimum or target was chosen than to be able to explain the reasoning behind an algorithmic decision.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Practical tips to develop a richer lifesyle.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Working hard for decades to afford an enjoyable retirement is an outdated concept. It is better to schedule mini-retirements and other exciting activities periodically. A &ldquo;newly rich&rdquo; lifestyle can be financed by developing products or ideas that can be sold to generate cash flow outside of established employment patterns.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&quot;&lsquo;Someday&rsquo; is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it &lsquo;eventually,&rsquo; just do it and correct course along the way.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for &lsquo;realistic&rsquo; goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The question you should be asking isn’t, &lsquo;What do I want?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What are my goals?&rsquo; but &lsquo;What would excite me?'&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A collection of stories that illustrate how to think more productively, creatively, and rationally.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>People have difficulties thinking rationally. They have biases that leads them to seek evidence that confirms what they already think, or are tempted to adopt views of friends, families, and colleagues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking like a freak&rdquo; means to get comfortable with admiting to not know the answer to a question. A &ldquo;freak&rdquo; re-defines the problem to answer the right questions, identifies the root cause, and thinks small to avoid intractable problems.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Incentives are the cornerstone of modern life. And understanding them—or, often, deciphering them—is the key to understanding a problem, and how it might be solved. Knowing what to measure, and how to measure it, can make a complicated world less so.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A growing body of research suggests that even the smartest people tend to seek out evidence that confirms what they already think, rather than new information that would give them a more robust view of reality.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Thinking like a Freak may sometimes sound like an exercise in using clever means to get exactly what you want, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But if there is one thing we’ve learned from a lifetime of designing and analyzing incentives, the best way to get what you want is to treat other people with decency.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The life and work principles of Ray Dalio, founder of investment firm Bridgewater Associates.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>An idea meritocracy is the best way to make decisions in a company. An idea meritocracy requires a commitment to truth and transparency. It can be achieved if people are open minded and ideas are evaluated based on the track record of the people who contribute them. The process can be supported by writing down and refining principles that support decision making and reflect learnings from the past.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;In 1966, asset prices reflected investors' optimism about the future. But between 1967 and 1979, bad economic surprises led to big and unexpected price declines. Not just the economy and the markets but social sentiment deteriorated as well. Living through that taught me that whilst almost everyone expects the future to be a slightly modified version of the present, it is usually very different.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;People still make the most important decisions better than computers do. To see this, you need look no further than at the kinds of people who are uniquely successful. Software developers, mathematicians, and game-theory modelers aren&rsquo;t running away with all the rewards; it is the people who have the most common sense, imagination, and determination.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Be especially wary of those who comment from the stands without having played on the field themselves and who don&rsquo;t have good logic, as they are dangerous to themselves and others.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Good metrics come about by first thinking of what information you need to answer your pressing questions and then figuring out how to get it. They do not come about by gathering information and putting it together to see what it tells you.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A sample of 21 of the destructive and damaging statues and policies that constitute the Indian Act.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Indian Act, passed in 1876, regulated and still regulates the lives of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. One of the most damaging and destructive parts of the act was the introduction of residential schools that forced children to move away from their families and forbade them to speak their home language and practice their traditional religion.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Canadian public and government have increased focus on reconciliation, paving the way to dismantle the Indian Act and move towards self-governance for Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If Canada and Canadians are going to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, then the existing relationship —the one based on the Indian Act— has to be rebuilt. The past cannot be overlooked or dismissed as &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo;, because it isn&rsquo;t; the impacts of the past are ongoing.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The focus should now be on dismantling the Indian Act, moving towards self-government in an orderly and timely fashion, and creating a self-governing future for Indigenous Peoples outside of the Indian Act.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;While self-government is not a quick fix for the deeply rooted social, health, and economic issues that plague Indingenous communities, it is a step towrds empowering communities to rebuild and heal from the intergenerational effects of residential schools.&quot;</em></p>
