<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The history of the rise and fall of the East India Company.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The East India company was a trading company based in London that rose from humble beginnings to a fully fledged imperial power that managed to replace the ruling Mughal empire on the Indian subcontinent in a short period of time between 1756 and 1803. In that time period the East India Company extended their sphere of influence through treachery, forged contracts, collaboration with local banker, bribes, and military prowess in armed conflicts and wars.</p>
<p>As a company, the EIC was answerable only to its shareholders. With no stake in the just governance of the region, or its long-term well-being, the Company&rsquo;s rule quickly turned into the straightforward pillage of India, and the rapid transfer westwards of its wealth.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;In many ways the East India Company was a model of commercial efficiency: one hundred years into its history, it had only thirty-five permanent employees in its head office. Nevertheless, that skeleton staff executed a corporate coup unparalleled in history: the military conquest, subjugation and plunder of vast tracts of southern Asia. It almost certainly remains the supreme act of corporate violence in world history.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In the end it was this access to unlimited reserves of credit, partly through stable flows of land revenues, and partly through the collaboration of Indian moneylenders and financiers, that in this period finally gave the Company its edge over their Indian rivals.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Because it was not the British government that seized India in the middle of the eighteenth century, but a private company. India&rsquo;s transition to colonialism took place through the mechanism of a for-profit corporation, which existed entirely for the purpose of enriching its investors.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The personal story of former Navy SEAL David Goggins who overcame traumatic experiences to become a successful soldier and athlete.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Most people do not know what they are truly capable of and resist challenging themselves physically and mentally to stretch the limits of their potential.</p>
<p>Unlocking this potential requires hard work and dedicated exposure to uncomfortable experiences and pain to &ldquo;callous&rdquo; the mind and become mentally strong.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the time I graduated, I knew that the confidence I’d managed to develop didn’t come from a perfect family or God-given talent. It came from personal accountability which brought me self-respect, and self-respect will always light a way forward.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A true leader stays exhausted, abhors arrogance, and never looks down on the weakest link. He fights for his men and leads by example.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Starting at zero is a mindset that says my refrigerator is never full, and it never will be. We can always become stronger and more agile, mentally and physically. We can always become more capable and more reliable. Since that’s the case we should never feel that our work is done. There is always more to do.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Bob Joseph</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A sample of 21 of the destructive and damaging statues and policies that constitute the Indian Act.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Indian Act, passed in 1876, regulated and still regulates the lives of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. One of the most damaging and destructive parts of the act was the introduction of residential schools that forced children to move away from their families and forbade them to speak their home language and practice their traditional religion.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Canadian public and government have increased focus on reconciliation, paving the way to dismantle the Indian Act and move towards self-governance for Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If Canada and Canadians are going to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, then the existing relationship —the one based on the Indian Act— has to be rebuilt. The past cannot be overlooked or dismissed as &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo;, because it isn&rsquo;t; the impacts of the past are ongoing.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The focus should now be on dismantling the Indian Act, moving towards self-government in an orderly and timely fashion, and creating a self-governing future for Indigenous Peoples outside of the Indian Act.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;While self-government is not a quick fix for the deeply rooted social, health, and economic issues that plague Indingenous communities, it is a step towrds empowering communities to rebuild and heal from the intergenerational effects of residential schools.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A practical guide to developing a product focussed management framework that allows competing in the Age of Software.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>We are at the turning point of the digital revolution. Companies need to transform their business practices to effectively leverage software development and technology. Many companies realize the need for transformation but rely on management practices that are not adequate for the task.</p>
<p>Products differ from projects in multiple ways. Products have a longer life cycle and receive incremental funding based on business results. The direct mapping to business results enables transparency into the delivery progress and the impact a product has. The Flow Framework is a way to track and visualize the network of product value streams of an organization and identify bottlenecks that require attention.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Software delivery concepts near and dear to technologists, such as technical debt and story points, are meaningless to most business leaders who manage IT initiatives as projects and measure them by whether they are on time and on budget.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The problem is not with visualizing the information; the problem is that, at a business level, we have not come up with a compelling set of abstractions for what to visualize. Contrast this with the DevOps team, who knows the exact telemetry to show, such as deploys per day and change success rate. Or contrast it with the development team, who uses Scrum or kanban boards to make work in progress visible to the entire team. In other words, the work should already be visible at the specialist and team level. It’s the business-level visibility that organizations lack. This is what flow metrics provide.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In contrast, the key aspect of tracking business outcomes using the Flow Framework is that they are tracked continually for each product-oriented value stream. This is in contrast to many existing approaches, which track metrics according to project or organizational structures. It is this shift in what we measure that is key to accomplishing the move from project to product, as accurate feedback at the right level of granularity is essential to supporting decision making.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Practical advice for founders how to build a successful startup and create something new.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Competition is a concept that has a high value in our educational system and economic thinking. The emphasis on competition leads to a uniform approach to development and only incremental improvements. Innovation and success come from avoiding competition and focusing on individual strengths and believes that set yourself apart from others.</p>
<p>If we believe the future to be something definite, we can create bold plans and see them through completion. An indefinite attitude leads to a lack of specific plans, missing innovation, and prevents us from shaping the future.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;Competition means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. So why do people believe that competition is healthy? The answer is that competition is not just an economic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology –the ideology– that pervades our society and distorts our thinking.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you&rsquo;ll give up on trying to master it. Indefinite attitudes to the future explain what&rsquo;s most dysfunctional in our world today. Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and calling it &lsquo;well-roundedness&rsquo;, a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substansive&ndash;to be a monopoly of one.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Jack Welch</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The life and professional career of Jack Welch, Chairman of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, described in his own words.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Leadership requires more than the knowledge to make sound business decisions. It is equally important to establish the right culture with a focus on people that allows for differentiation and development, and that empowers everyone to contribute ideas (&ldquo;boundaryless&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Being able to react to changes trumps a well thought out longterm strategy. Speed and decisiveness are important to remain competitive in changing circumstances even if not all decisions or judgment calls stand the test of time. The characterization of some associates who receive high praise in the book but were later on criticized for their leadership (Jeff Immelt, Bob Nardelli) or general conduct (Roger Ailes, Matt Lauer), is one example that appears to not have aged well.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;We learned the hard way that we could have the greatest strategies in the world. Without the right leaders developing and owning them, we&rsquo;d get good-looking presentations and so-so results.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Business success is less a function of grandiose predictions than it is a result of being able to respond rapidly to real changes as they occur. That&rsquo;s why strategy has to be dynamic and anticipatory.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Informality isn&rsquo;t about first names, unassigned parking spaces, or casual clothing. It&rsquo;s so much deeper. It&rsquo;s about making sure everybody counts&ndash;and everbody knows they count.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Your back room is somebody else&rsquo;s front room &hellip; Don&rsquo;t own a cafeteria: Let a food company do it. Don&rsquo;t run a print shop: Let a printing company do it. It&rsquo;s understanding where your real value added is and putting your best people and resources behind that.</em>&rdquo;</p>
