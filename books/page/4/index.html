<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>David Goggins</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The personal story of former Navy SEAL David Goggins who overcame traumatic experiences to become a successful soldier and athlete.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Most people do not know what they are truly capable of and resist challenging themselves physically and mentally to stretch the limits of their potential.</p>
<p>Unlocking this potential requires hard work and dedicated exposure to uncomfortable experiences and pain to &ldquo;callous&rdquo; the mind and become mentally strong.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;By the time I graduated, I knew that the confidence I’d managed to develop didn’t come from a perfect family or God-given talent. It came from personal accountability which brought me self-respect, and self-respect will always light a way forward.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;A true leader stays exhausted, abhors arrogance, and never looks down on the weakest link. He fights for his men and leads by example.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Starting at zero is a mindset that says my refrigerator is never full, and it never will be. We can always become stronger and more agile, mentally and physically. We can always become more capable and more reliable. Since that’s the case we should never feel that our work is done. There is always more to do.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Jack Welch</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>The life and professional career of Jack Welch, Chairman of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, described in his own words.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Leadership requires more than the knowledge to make sound business decisions. It is equally important to establish the right culture with a focus on people that allows for differentiation and development, and that empowers everyone to contribute ideas (&ldquo;boundaryless&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Being able to react to changes trumps a well thought out longterm strategy. Speed and decisiveness are important to remain competitive in changing circumstances even if not all decisions or judgment calls stand the test of time. The characterization of some associates who receive high praise in the book but were later on criticized for their leadership (Jeff Immelt, Bob Nardelli) or general conduct (Roger Ailes, Matt Lauer), is one example that appears to not have aged well.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;We learned the hard way that we could have the greatest strategies in the world. Without the right leaders developing and owning them, we&rsquo;d get good-looking presentations and so-so results.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Business success is less a function of grandiose predictions than it is a result of being able to respond rapidly to real changes as they occur. That&rsquo;s why strategy has to be dynamic and anticipatory.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Informality isn&rsquo;t about first names, unassigned parking spaces, or casual clothing. It&rsquo;s so much deeper. It&rsquo;s about making sure everybody counts&ndash;and everbody knows they count.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Your back room is somebody else&rsquo;s front room &hellip; Don&rsquo;t own a cafeteria: Let a food company do it. Don&rsquo;t run a print shop: Let a printing company do it. It&rsquo;s understanding where your real value added is and putting your best people and resources behind that.</em>&rdquo;</p>
