<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A historical analysis of the working mechanisms of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been the sole legitimate governing authority in China since 1949. By the end of 2009 when the book was published, the CCP had 78 million members.</p>
<p>The Party consists of a giant network of people that are involved in every important decision and its members have built up the skills and experience to run the country. It has remained in power by supporting a boisterous private economy and keeping strict control over personnel, propaganda, and the army. Since the Party was founded it has systematically &ldquo;has eradicated or emasculated political rivals; eliminated the autonomy of the courts and press; restricted religion and civil society; deningrated rival versions of nationhood; centralized political power; established extensive networks of security police; and dispatched dissidents to labour camps.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;As an organization, the Party sits outside, and above the law. It should have a legal identity, in other words, a person to sue, but it is not even registered as an organization. The Party exists outside the legal system altogether.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Party’s control over personnel was at the heart of its ability to overhaul state companies, without losing leverage over them at the same time. So important does the Party rate its power to hire and fire government officials that it places it on a par with its control over the media and the military.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The policy cycles follow a familiar pattern, the Chinese economists say: ‘Decentralization leads to disorder; disorder leads to centralization; centralization leads to stagnation and stagnation leads to decentralization.’&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Deng, and Jiang after him, grasped what many of their conservative opponents never did–that the Party had much in common with private entrepreneurs, who disliked democratic politics and independent unions as much as they did. The Party’s authoritarian powers not only kept workers in line. They also bestowed on policy-makers a flexibility that politicians in democratic countries could only dream about. Even by the standards of a capitalist economy, the Party could be unusually pro-business, as long as the state got a cut along the way.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="author">Author</h3>
<p>Bob Joseph</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A sample of 21 of the destructive and damaging statues and policies that constitute the Indian Act.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>The Indian Act, passed in 1876, regulated and still regulates the lives of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. One of the most damaging and destructive parts of the act was the introduction of residential schools that forced children to move away from their families and forbade them to speak their home language and practice their traditional religion.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Canadian public and government have increased focus on reconciliation, paving the way to dismantle the Indian Act and move towards self-governance for Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;If Canada and Canadians are going to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, then the existing relationship —the one based on the Indian Act— has to be rebuilt. The past cannot be overlooked or dismissed as &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo;, because it isn&rsquo;t; the impacts of the past are ongoing.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The focus should now be on dismantling the Indian Act, moving towards self-government in an orderly and timely fashion, and creating a self-governing future for Indigenous Peoples outside of the Indian Act.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;While self-government is not a quick fix for the deeply rooted social, health, and economic issues that plague Indingenous communities, it is a step towrds empowering communities to rebuild and heal from the intergenerational effects of residential schools.&quot;</em></p>
