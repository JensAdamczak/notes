<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A warning of the destructive power of black-box algorithms that govern our lives.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Algorithms and mathematical models are ubiquitously applied and drive decisions in every aspect of our lives. They, for example, determine college admissions, calculate insurance fees, and determine the content in our social media feeds. Many of the algorithms are intransparent, making it impossible to understand and challenge the results. If there is no alignment between the objectives of the models and the interest of the modeled subjects and if there is no feedback loop to improve the model over time, these &ldquo;weapons of math destruction (WMD)&rdquo; can cause significant harm.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;The first question is: Even if the participant is aware of being modeled, or what the model is used for, is the model opaque, or even invisible?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;That makes it extra hard to answer the second question: Does the model work against the subject&rsquo;s interest? In short, is it unfair? Does it damage or destroy lives?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The third question is whether a model has the capacity to grow exponentially. As a statistician would put it, can it scale? This might sound like the nerdy quibble of a mathematician. But scale is what turns WMDs from local nuisances into tsunami forces, ones that define and delimit our lives.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;So to sum up, these are the three elements of a WMD; Opacity, Scale, and Damage.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Hans Rosling</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A plea to overcome the human instincts that prevent us from developing a fact based worldview.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Knowledge of global patterns and trends is poor across demographics even though data is publicly available. Common assumptions about topics like population growth, income inequality, education and health, are not only wrong but are systematically distorted. Developments appear more negatively than they are. Reasons are a lack of statistical literacy and our instincts to generalize, blame others, and consider things without appropriate comparison frames and proportions. To develop a fact based and more accurate worldview, we need to be aware of these instincts and work actively to overcome them.</p>
<p>Societal change is happening steadily but slowly and often not considered newsworthy. The lack of attention makes it hard to identify emerging patterns and adapt to a changing landscape. The Western view is systematically underestimating the progress in Asia and especially Africa, and the significant role these continents will play in a future global economy.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;The data shows that half the increase in child survival in the world happens because mothers can read and write. More children now survive because they don&rsquo;t get ill in the first place. &hellip; So if you are investing money to improve health on Level 1 and 2, you should put it into primary schools, nurse education, and vaccinations. Big impressive-looking hospitals can wait.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;People in North America and Europe need to understand that most of the world population lives in Asia. In terms of economic muscles &lsquo;we&rsquo; are becoming the 20 percent, not the 80 percent. But many of &lsquo;us&rsquo; can&rsquo;t fit these numbers into our nostalgic minds. Not only do we misjudge how big our war monuments should be in Vietnam, we also misjudge our importance in the future global marketplace. Many of us forget to behave properly with those who will control the future trade deals.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Anyone who claims that democracy is a necessity for economic growth and health improvements will risk getting contradicted by reality. It&rsquo;s better to argue for democracy as a goal in itself instead of as a superior means to other goals we like.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;In fact, resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it&rsquo;s almost always more complicated than that.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A scientific view of the role that DNA plays in understanding human history, and what we can and cannot conclude when analyzing it.</p>
<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<p>Depicting our ancestry looks more like an entagled mesh than a tree. Everyone living today shares the same group of ancestors if we go back long enough in time.</p>
<p>DNA influences observable characteristics in a probabilitic way. There are only a few genes that have a clear physical manifestation. The scientific reality is more complex than newspaper headlines make you believe.</p>
<h3 id="quotes">Quotes</h3>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that the commercial DNA ancestry tests don&rsquo;t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. They show with whom you have common ancestry today.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The truth is that we all are a bit of everything, and we come from all over. Even if you live in the most remote parts of the Hebrides, or the edge of the Greek Aegean, we share an ancestor only a few hundred years ago. A thousand years ago, we Europeans share all of our ancestry. Triple that time and we share all our ancestry with everyone on Earth.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;No one will ever find a gene for &lsquo;evil&rsquo;, or for beauty, or for musical genius, or for scientific genius, because they don&rsquo;t exist. DNA is not destiny. The presence of a particular variant of a particular gene may just have the effect of altering the odds of any particular behavior. More likely, the possession of many slight differences in many genes will have an effect on the likelihood of a particular characteristic, in consort with your environment, which includes all things that are not DNA.&quot;</em></p>
