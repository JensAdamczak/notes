Takeaways An idea meritocracy is the best way to make decisions in a company. An idea meritocracy requires a commitment to truth and transparency.

The process can be supported by writing down and refining principles that support decision making and reflect learnings from the past.</description>

Summary Advice for a more strategic approach to career planning.
Takeaways Corporations typically don&amp;rsquo;t operate rationally as they consist of people who have their own benefits in mind. Career progression requires a strategic approach and tactical steps contrary to commonly accepted practices.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t be overly passionate about your ideas and rather be objective in providing optionality Embrace the changes everyone else hates Learn to promote your ideas instead of refining them without feedback Avoid a too strong focus on result orientation and instead spend time expanding your skill set Don&amp;rsquo;t be a part of the heard, and don&amp;rsquo;t gossip about peers and superiors Find big problems to solve Don&amp;rsquo;t hold peers accountable and mentor them wherever possible  Quotes &amp;ldquo;People inherently want to work with people similar to themselves and who they like.</description>

Summary The story of establishing a culture of freedom and resonsponsibility at Netflix.
Takeaways Netflix leadership has identified two key ingredients for a creative and innovative culture: candor and talent density. Employees are empowered to contribute their opinions and ideas. They need to get enough context about the business priorities to take ownership and make informed decisions without the burden of a buerocratic approval process. Netflix aims to attract top talent and rather pays for one highly capable employee than for ten mediocre ones.</description>

To avoid a disconnect, Data Scientists need to share work in progress frequently. Software development methodolodies like Scrum need to be adapted to account for the larger uncertainty of data exploration.</description>

      <description>Author Chip Heath, Dan Heath
Summary An overview of communication techniques for effective messaging of ideas.
Takeaways In order for ideas to stick with an audience they have to be framed as Simple Unexpected Concrete Credible Emotional Stories (SUCCES). If we follow the SUCCES framework, we can drill to the core of the message to know what to say (simple) and frame it in a way that helps people to pay attention (unexpected), understand and remember (concrete), believe and agree (credible), care (emotional), and act (stories).</description>

Summary The story of a plant manager who discovers the benefit of systematically assessing the processing bottlenecks instead of relying on conventional wisdom.
Takeaways Instead of relying on conventional wisdom, it is crucial to deeply reflect on the goal of an operation or organization and take a scientific and systematic approach to explore the factors (bottlenecks or constraints) that prevent us from reaching it.
The following process can serve as a blueprint to work towards achieving any goal.</description>

      <description>Author Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil
Summary A warning of the destructive power of black-box algorithms that govern our lives.
Takeaways Algorithms and mathematical models are ubiquitously applied and drive decisions in every aspect of our lives. They, for example, determine college admissions, calculate insurance fees, and determine the content in our social media feeds. Many of the algorithms are intransparent, making it impossible to understand and challenge the results. If there is no alignment between the objectives of the models and the interest of the modeled subjects and if there is no feedback loop to improve the model over time, these &amp;ldquo;weapons of math destruction (WMD)&amp;rdquo; can cause significant harm.</description>

      <description>Author Jack Welch
Summary The life and professional career of Jack Welch, Chairman of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, described in his own words.
Takeaways Leadership requires more than the knowledge to make sound business decisions. It is equally important to establish the right culture with a focus on people that allows for differentiation and development, and that empowers everyone to contribute ideas (&amp;ldquo;boundaryless&amp;rdquo;).
Being able to react to changes trumps a well thought out longterm strategy.</description>
