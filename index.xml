Summary Scientific answers to existential questions.
Takeaways Existential questions deal with the origin and working mechanisms of the universe, and the role of humans in it. While the fundamental theories of the standard model of particle physics and the theory of general relativity have been very successful in providing explanations, many questions have no scientifically sound answer yet. In their attempt to extend our knowledge, some scientists include assumptions in their theories that are unnecessary to explain observations, conflating scientific reasoning and belief.</description>

Summary An analysis of the science, psychology and philosophy of gambling.
Takeaway Gambling is the speculation on the future that can take on different forms such as casino games, sports betting, and financial investing. Outcomes in these areas are hard to predict and it is even harder to make money from it against benchmarks that encapsulate the collective information of large crowds. Gamblers often underestimate the randomness that determine gambling outcomes and attribute positive outcomes to their own ability to predict the future.</description>

Summary Practical tips to develop a richer lifesyle.
Takeaways Working hard for decades to afford an enjoyable retirement is an outdated concept. It is better to schedule mini-retirements and other exciting activities periodically.

Summary Advice for a more strategic approach to career planning.
Takeaways Corporations typically don&amp;rsquo;t operate rationally as they consist of people who have their own benefits in mind. Career progression requires a strategic approach and tactical steps contrary to commonly accepted practices.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t be overly passionate about your ideas and rather be objective in providing optionality Embrace the changes everyone else hates Learn to promote your ideas instead of refining them without feedback Avoid a too strong focus on result orientation and instead spend time expanding your skill set Don&amp;rsquo;t be a part of the heard, and don&amp;rsquo;t gossip about peers and superiors Find big problems to solve Don&amp;rsquo;t hold peers accountable and mentor them wherever possible  Quotes &amp;ldquo;People inherently want to work with people similar to themselves and who they like.</description>

Summary The story of establishing a culture of freedom and resonsponsibility at Netflix.
Takeaways Netflix leadership has identified two key ingredients for a creative and innovative culture: candor and talent density. Employees are empowered to contribute their opinions and ideas. They need to get enough context about the business priorities to take ownership and make informed decisions without the burden of a buerocratic approval process. Netflix aims to attract top talent and rather pays for one highly capable employee than for ten mediocre ones.</description>

Summary A summary of decision hygiene practices to reduce noise in judgments.

      <description>Author Russel Jurney
Summary Instructions for a technical setup to iteratively develop practical Data Science applications.
Takeaways Many Data Science applications fail because of a missing feedback loop between the Data Scientists developing the solutions and the business stakeholders and users. To avoid a disconnect, Data Scientists need to share work in progress frequently.

      <description>Author Chip Heath, Dan Heath
Summary An overview of communication techniques for effective messaging of ideas.
Takeaways In order for ideas to stick with an audience they have to be framed as Simple Unexpected Concrete Credible Emotional Stories (SUCCES). If we follow the SUCCES framework, we can drill to the core of the message to know what to say (simple) and frame it in a way that helps people to pay attention (unexpected), understand and remember (concrete), believe and agree (credible), care (emotional), and act (stories).</description>

Summary A warning of the destructive power of black-box algorithms that govern our lives.
Takeaways Algorithms and mathematical models are ubiquitously applied and drive decisions in every aspect of our lives. They, for example, determine college admissions, calculate insurance fees, and determine the content in our social media feeds. Many of the algorithms are intransparent, making it impossible to understand and challenge the results. If there is no alignment between the objectives of the models and the interest of the modeled subjects and if there is no feedback loop to improve the model over time, these &amp;ldquo;weapons of math destruction (WMD)&amp;rdquo; can cause significant harm.</description>

Summary A plea to overcome the human instincts that prevent us from developing a fact based worldview.
Takeaways Knowledge of global patterns and trends is poor across demographics even though data is publicly available. Common assumptions about topics like population growth, income inequality, education and health, are not only wrong but are systematically distorted. Developments appear more negatively than they are. Reasons are a lack of statistical literacy and our instincts to generalize, blame others, and consider things without appropriate comparison frames and proportions.</description>

      <description>Author Jack Welch
Summary The life and professional career of Jack Welch, Chairman of General Electric from 1981 to 2001, described in his own words.
Takeaways Leadership requires more than the knowledge to make sound business decisions. It is equally important to establish the right culture with a focus on people that allows for differentiation and development, and that empowers everyone to contribute ideas (&amp;ldquo;boundaryless&amp;rdquo;).
Being able to react to changes trumps a well thought out longterm strategy.</description>

      <description>Author Adam Rutherford
Summary A scientific view of the role that DNA plays in understanding human history, and what we can and cannot conclude when analyzing it.
Takeaways Depicting our ancestry looks more like an entagled mesh than a tree. Everyone living today shares the same group of ancestors if we go back long enough in time.
DNA influences observable characteristics in a probabilitic way. There are only a few genes that have a clear physical manifestation.</description>

      <description>Counting the number of posts and different terms per taxonomy in Hugo requires looping through all taxonomies.
{{ range $taxname, $tax := .Site.Taxonomies }} {{ $nposts := len (where $.Site.RegularPages (print &amp;#34;Params&amp;#34; &amp;#34;.&amp;#34; $taxname) &amp;#34;ne&amp;#34; nil) }} {{ $nterms := len $tax }} {{ $posttext := cond (gt $nposts 1) &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34; &amp;#34;post&amp;#34; }} {{ $termtext := cond (gt $nterms 1) &amp;#34;terms&amp;#34; &amp;#34;term&amp;#34; }} {{ $taxname }}: {{ $nposts }} {{ $posttext }} and {{ $nterms }} search {{ $termtext }}.</description>

      <description>This Website has been built with Hugo.
The main Hugo Website already has good documentation. The following additional resources were particularly helpful to get started and create a new template that fit my needs.
Getting started youtube/introduction_to_hugo
A series of instructional videos by Mike Dane (@mike_dane) that explain the basics of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s concepts like templates, blocks, and front-matter. Very useful to get a first exposure and a rough idea of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s capabilities.</description>
