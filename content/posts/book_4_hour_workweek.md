### Author

Timothy Ferris

### Summary

Practical tips to develop a richer lifesyle.

### Takeaways

Working hard for decades to afford an enjoyable retirement is an outdated concept. It is better to schedule mini-retirements and other exciting activities periodically. A "newly rich" lifestyle can be financed by developing products or ideas that can be sold to generate cash flow outside of established employment patterns.

### Quotes

*"'Someday' is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it 'eventually,' just do it and correct course along the way."*

*"What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have."*

*"It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming."*

*"The question you should be asking isn’t, 'What do I want?' or 'What are my goals?' but 'What would excite me?'"*
