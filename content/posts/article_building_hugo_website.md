This Website has been built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The main Hugo Website already has good documentation. The following additional
resources were particularly helpful to get started and create a [new
template](https://github.com/JensAdamczak/hugo-snippets) that fit my needs. 

## Getting started

A series of instructional videos by Mike Dane
([@mike_dane](https://twitter.com/mike_dane)) that explain the basics of Hugo's
concepts like templates, blocks, and front-matter. Very useful to get a first
exposure and a rough idea of Hugo's capabilities.

## Step by step instruction

Janne Kemppainen ([@pakstech](https://twitter.com/pakstech)) illustrates in
this blog post what needs to be done to create a Hugo website from scratch and
implement all the necessary components. Very nice and instructive. 

## Themes

An overview of a variety of Hugo themes that already have been created. This
Website was inspired mostly by
[nanxiaobei/hugo-paper](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) and
[adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

## Lookup rules

Hugo's flexibility can lead to confusion about the best way to structure the
site. Understanding the lookup rules proved essential to get clarity. Once they
are understood, creating the project outline leaves some room for personal
preferences.
 
## Site deployment

[gohugo/hosting-on-github](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#deployment-of-project-pages-from-your-gh-pages-branch)

This Website is hosted on Github Pages. Source code and published Website are
kept separate and the deployment of new content works with the [publish
script](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#put-it-into-a-script-1),
mentioned in the link above.
