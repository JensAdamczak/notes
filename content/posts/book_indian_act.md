### Summary

A sample of 21 of the destructive and damaging statues and policies that constitute the Indian Act.

### Takeaways

The Indian Act, passed in 1876, regulated and still regulates the lives of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. One of the most damaging and destructive parts of the act was the introduction of residential schools that forced children to move away from their families and forbade them to speak their home language and practice their traditional religion.

In recent years, the Canadian public and government have increased focus on reconciliation, paving the way to dismantle the Indian Act and move towards self-governance for Indigenous Peoples.

### Quotes

*"If Canada and Canadians are going to reconcile with Indigenous Peoples, then the existing relationship &mdash;the one based on the Indian Act&mdash; has to be rebuilt. The past cannot be overlooked or dismissed as 'ancient history', because it isn't; the impacts of the past are ongoing."*

*"The focus should now be on dismantling the Indian Act, moving towards self-government in an orderly and timely fashion, and creating a self-governing future for Indigenous Peoples outside of the Indian Act."*

*"While self-government is not a quick fix for the deeply rooted social, health, and economic issues that plague Indingenous communities, it is a step towrds empowering communities to rebuild and heal from the intergenerational effects of residential schools."*
