  <section>
    <p>Author Chip Heath, Dan Heath
Summary An overview of communication techniques for effective messaging of ideas.

  <section>
    <p>Author Cathy O’Neil
Summary A warning of the destructive power of black-box algorithms that govern our lives.
Takeaways Algorithms and mathematical models are ubiquitously applied and drive decisions in every aspect of our lives. They, for example, determine college admissions, calculate insurance fees, and determine the content in our social media feeds.
